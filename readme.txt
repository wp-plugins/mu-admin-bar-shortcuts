== Description ==

This is a simple plugin that adds plugin & theme add & manage shortcut links to the admin bar for Multisite managers.

I'm constantly adding, removing and otherwise managing plugins and themes on my WP Multisite networks. I personally found it tiresome to click through to the plugin and theme management area of my network admin as often as I do, and wanted to speed up the process. 

This plugin adds four links to the admin bar as a drop down, allowing 1 click access to add & manage network plugins & themes from anywhere in your network.

NOTE: Only super admins will see these shortcuts.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `muadminbarshortcuts.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. RESULT: The MU Admin Bar shortcuts will be displayed in your admin bar
